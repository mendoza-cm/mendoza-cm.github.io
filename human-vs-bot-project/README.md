<h1>Human-Vs-Bot Response Behavior</h1>
<p>
The project repository is made up of several R files, but also contains code for Python. With the exception of simulating test data, most analysis reamain the same between the two languages.
The PNG files in each of the sections, simulating data, logistic regression, and machine learning contain both R and Python plots/output. The scripts contain additional visualizations not 
  included in the web pages.

<p>
  <em>Response behavior</em> refers to an event or some kind of interaction between a user, whether it be human or a bot, and a website. When a web page is accessed, data collection has 
  already commenced and any interaction, including a mouse click or a touch sensor activation, is recorded; this project simulates the data for persons response behavior from their first interaction
  with the website and evey one for up to some end time.

<p>
  There are three parts to this project: 
  
  <ul>
    <li>Data simulation - we did not scrape a webpage, but instead created functions that would produce data that might reflect human and bot behavior or 
  response times when accessing a website.</li>
  <li>Logistic regression - once the data is prepped, we use logisitc regrssion for prediction and review criteria for validation.</li>
  <li>[Other] machine learning methods - we consider SVM and RF, invoking kernels and comparing methods.</li>
</ul>
