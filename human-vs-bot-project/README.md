<h1>Human-Vs-Bot Response Behavior</h1>
<p>
The project repository is made up of several R files, but also contains code for Python. With the exception of simulating test data, most analysis reamain the same between the two languages.
The PNG files in each of the sections, simulating data, logistic regression, and machine learning contain both R and Python plots/output. The scripts contain additional visualizations not 
  included in the web pages.
