        <h1>Logistic Regression</h1>
             <p>Logistic regression models the log-odds of an event as a linear combination of variables; the odds can be re-written in terms of probabilities <var>p</var> : 
<div class="eq-c">
  <p>\[
\log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = X\beta + \epsilon
\]</p>
</div>
        Where \(X\) is an \(n \times (\nu + 1)\) matrix, with \(\nu\) being the number of predictors; <var>p</var> is usually used in place of \(\nu\),
        but we use \(\nu\) here to distinquish it from the probability, <var>p</var>, used in the equation above. Furthermore, \(\beta\) is a \((\nu + 1) \times 1\) matrix
        and both \(Y\) and \(\epsilon\) are \(n \times 1 \) matrices. 
     </p>

    Logistic regression is often used as a classification tool: at least one cut-point or threshold must be selected to differentiate between classes. 
    For instance, if we choose a logit score that corresponds with a probability of 0.5 as our cut-point, cases that are run through the model that are
    found to have a probability at or below 0.5 can be classified into one class and all cases found to have a probability above 0.5 are classified into the 
    other class. With respect to our Human-vs-Bot project, where we are trying to distinguish between human and bot behavior (isBot == 1) with respect to click rate and click standard deviation,
    a logit score of zero, corresponding to <var>p</var> = 0.50, or lower could be classified as a human and scores higher than zero, we could classify as bots.</p>

<p>
    Deciding where to place a cut-point is not always easy. In many cases, it is imperative to look at several cut-points and their corresponding descriminative and predictive statistics.
    Descriminative statistics are values such as the false positive rate, true positive rate (sensitivity), false negative rate, and the true negative rate (specificity). The area under
    the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is an excellent measure of a models descriminative ability - it considers all possible cut points: values close to 1 indicate 
    better descrimination. In our example of simulated data and selected model -- setting the bot type as the outcome of interest, an AUC value between 0 & 1, can be summarized as the 
    probability that a randomly selected bot has a higher score than a randomly selected human (isBot == 0).

    The predictive values determine the predictive ability of a model, but a cut-point must be chosen: proportion of cases the model correctly identified. In our example,
    the positive predictive value is the proportion of cases the model correctly identified as bots
    and the negative predictive value is the proportion of cases the model correctly identified as humans(or not bots): it all depends on the cut-point; otherwise, we
    cannot determine what class a case was predicted to be.

<p>
     A decision table is a really good way to organize and consider viable cut-points.
