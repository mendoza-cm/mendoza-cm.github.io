Welcome! The struggle is real; in this economy it's all about downsizing and being resourceful, so I'm hopping on the wagon. This portfolio combines my love for stories and my knack for data. These projects don’t overlap, and someday they might split into separate .io pages. For now, they’re what I’ve got, built to show I can tell stories and crunch numbers for advertising.


# Data Science & Analytics

## Human-vs-Bot
This project spans three pages: simulating user data in R, testing logistic regression, and exploring advanced ML (random forests, SVM) for bot detection. It’s built for ad applications like optimizing campaigns or targeting audiences.
