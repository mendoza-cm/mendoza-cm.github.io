## Me
I am a data scientist: I learn and do whatever I need -- to understand how to put data together to make meaningful conclusions.

I bring experience across the full data lifecycle, from prior to its existence -- collaborating on what to request, to initial data wrangling and preparation and finally,
analysis and communicating results.
